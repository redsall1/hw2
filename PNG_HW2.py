# This is the second programming assignment of the computer science track.
# For each function, a skeleton is provided, where your job is to fill the *TODO* out.
# The questions will cover the topics learned in the second lecture, which entailed
# recursive functions, for and while loops, string indexing, and linked lists.

# This function takes a natural number as an argument (so it can't be negative) 
# and returns a boolean value of true or false that shows whether the inputted 
# number is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is something that reads the same 
# backward as forward (i.e. '2002'). Use a for or while for the implementation 
# of this function.
# Ex) iterative_palindrome(1) -> true
#     iterative_palindrome(12) -> false
#     iterative_palindrome(2468642) -> true
def iterative_palindrome(n):
    tf = True
    if len(n) == 1:
       tf = True
    else:
        for i in range(len(n)):
            if n[i] != n[-(i+1)]:
                tf = False
                break
    
    return tf

# This function is the same as iterative_palindrome() except instead of using a
# loop, implement the function in a recursive way.
# Ex) recursive_palindrome(1) -> true
#     recursive_palindrome(12) -> false
#     recursive_palindrome(2468642) -> true
def recurisve_palindrome(n):
    #TODO
    return

# Helper function for sum_factorials(). Takes a number as an argument and returns
# the factorial of that number.
# Ex) factorial(1) -> 1
#     factorial(4) -> 24
#     factorial(7) -> 5040
def factorial(n):
    #TODO
    return

# Helper function for sum_factorials(). Takes a number as an argument and returns
# a boolean value of true or false that shows whether the inputted number is a 
# prime or not.
# Ex) is_prime(7) -> true
#     is_prime(12) -> false
#     is_prime(23) -> true
def is_prime(n):
    tf = True
    for i in range(2,len(n)):
        if n%i ==0:
            tf = False
            break
    return tf

# Function that creates a node to help testing of sum_factorials()
class Node:
    def __init__(self, content): 
        self.content = content
        self.content = next

# Function to insert a node to the beginning of a linked list
def push(head_ptr, new_content):
    new_node = Node(0)
    new_node.content = new_content
    new_node.next = (head_ptr)
    (head_ptr) = new_node
    return head_ptr

# This function takes a pointer to the head node of the linked list as an argument
# and returns the sum of factorials of prime numbers in the linked list. Above are
# two helper functions for this that are highly recommended.
# Ex) lst = None
#     lst = push(lst, 2)
#     lst = push(lst, 14)
#     lst = push(lst, 5)
#     lst = push(lst, 3)
#     lst = push(lst, 6)
#     sum_factorials(lst) -> 128
def sum_factorials(head_ptr):
    #TODO
    return
